## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **surgery wait times across Canadian provinces** to uncover disparities in healthcare delivery and identify trends affecting access to medical care:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

By combining government datasets with Python-based analysis, the project highlights the **average wait times by procedure and priority**, providing insights for healthcare decision-makers and patients alike.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Compare wait times across **provinces and territories**.  
- Examine trends for **priority vs non-priority procedures**.  
- Identify factors contributing to **regional disparities**.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for healthcare policy.

## 📊 Dataset  
- Source: **Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)**:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Period: 2008 – 2021 (updated in 2022).  
- Features: Province, procedure type, priority, wait time (days).  
- Medical procedures covered: Hip/Knee replacements, Cataract surgery, CABG, Cancer surgeries, MRI, CT scan, Radiation therapy:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Canada’s **average healthcare wait time hit 27.4 weeks in 2022**, the longest ever recorded:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- Wait times have risen **195% since 1993** (from 9.3 weeks to 27.4 weeks):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- **Priority surgeries** saw shorter waits but still exceeded national benchmarks in some regions.
